# Quick Start Guide

## To Run the Website:

1. **Install dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and go to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

The website should now be running!

## If you see a 404 error:

1. Make sure you ran `npm install` first
2. Make sure the dev server is running (`npm run dev`)
3. Check that the terminal shows: "Local: http://localhost:5173"
4. Try refreshing the page

## Build for Production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with optimized files ready to deploy.
